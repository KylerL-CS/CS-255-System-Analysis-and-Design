Brief Summary of the DriverPass Project:
DriverPass is a fictional company that offers driver education and DMV testing prep. They needed a system that allows students to register, schedule lessons, take practice tests, and receive feedback, while instructors and administrators manage lessons, accounts, and system settings. The goal was to design a web-based solution that supports all of these user roles efficiently.

What Did I Do Well?
I feel confident about the way I laid out the system’s structure using UML diagrams. The use case and activity diagrams clearly show how users move through the system, and the class diagram helped me organize the core data relationships. I also put careful thought into identifying hardware, software, and network requirements that support accessibility, performance, and security.

What Would I Revise?
If I had more time, I would refine the sequence diagram to include more detailed interactions between system components. A clearer breakdown of the exact messages passed between objects would help developers understand the technical flow more precisely.

How I Interpreted User Needs:
I reviewed the client’s interview and extracted key functions each user type required. From there, I translated those needs into system features and workflows using UML tools. Thinking about the user first helped ensure the design would be intuitive and practical. It’s crucial to build around user needs—without that, the system might be functional, but not helpful.

My Approach to Designing Software:
I start with identifying users and their goals, then use diagrams to map out how they’ll interact with the system. In the future, I plan to use more agile techniques like wireframing, early user feedback, and iterative updates to improve my designs. I also want to continue using tools like Lucidchart to keep my system documentation visual and easy to understand.
